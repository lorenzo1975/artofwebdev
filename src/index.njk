                  I have been first and foremost a Client of my own products, yes you read it right! In the early 2000&#39; it was still possible to create a 
                  successfull business by having a relatively good idea and a website, and that&#39; what I did! My first
                  online venture was a local airbnb style accommodation booking website for the city of Florence, Italy. 
                  <br> <br>
                  You know what was the hardest part? Finding developers that were affordable and professional to create your vision, the bitter answer is that there aren&#39;t many! I have 
                  learned the painful lesson burning my own hands and wallet! From local web agencies to online outsourcing finding 
                  the right balance between cost and skills is very hard.
                  <br><br>
                   Enough was enough and after selling my business I set aside some time to improve my web dev skills from basic website building, wordpress development to some more serious and professional skills. Oh buoy how deep the rabbit hole goes I didn' expect! I love technology so it wasn't a sacrifice but web development from 2012 onwards have litterally exploded in complexity and overengeneering. Framework, tools are enough to scare you off.

                  I can build from not so trivial, well optimized, modern landing / websites with custom design and code to medium size fullstack web applications
                  to scale your business. This with a bit of long term vision and my experience in this world, what might work and what might not work. Where to invest and 
                  where to save.
